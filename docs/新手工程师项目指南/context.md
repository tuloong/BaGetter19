**Task**: 我是一个新手工程师，怎么接手这个项目，有哪些能够开发的点 | I'm a junior engineer, how to take over this project and what are the development points?
**Repo path**: c:/Users/voloz/Documents/GitHub/BaGetter19
**Desired parallelism**: 2 (1-3 is typical)

The Orchestrator must decide:

- Whether to specialise the workflow to this repo or keep it generic.
- How many identical Specialist instances to launch (0 = sequential).
